# Loan_status_prediction
## Project Description
A machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of loan approval based on certain variables or features.
## Project Goals
The primary goal of the project is to improve loan approval accuracy and help financial institutions make better decisions when it comes to loan approvals.
## Observations
- Shape of data is (614,13).
- There are some missing values in the dataset so I handled those missing values by anlayze and filling with their respective mean, median and mode values and if missing valus are less than 5% then I drop them.
- There are some categorical values in data so I convert them into numerical values as machine learning algorithms only understand integer values.
- The target variable is Loan_Status.
- In our data set values are not in the same range so did feature scaling.
## Description
- Loan_status_prediction is a Binary classification problem where we predict that whether a particular loan should approved or not.
## Methods Used
- Supervised Learning - Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier.
## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
